# Bikesharing

## Project Overview

In this project, we did an analysis on a dataset to use in our bike-sharing proposal for the city of Des Moines. The first deliverable in this challenge was to pull bike sharing data from the Citi Bike System for August 2019. From there we used Jupyter Notebook to create a dataframe using Pandas. We then used Pandas to change the data type of our "Trip Duration" column from the "int64" data type to the "datetime64" data type. After that was completed we exported our dataframe to a new .csv file that we would use in Tableau for Deliverable 2. We were able to use our new trip data .csv file to manipulate and create 5 different visualizations that we would be able to use in our proposal. The final deliverable involved creating a story in Tableau with our visualizations that we previously created.

## Results

The bar chart above shows the peak usage hours for the bike sharing program. We can see that the busiest time for bike usage is around 17:00-18:00. We can also see that the lowest usage hours are from all hours before 5:00.

The next visual that we have is a symbol map and we've used it to show the most popular places for bike usage. We can drill down to get exact coordinates on where the most popular spots are for bike rentals. We would expect to see hot spots around popular tourist destinations since many tourists can get around easier in a larger city on a bicycle.
